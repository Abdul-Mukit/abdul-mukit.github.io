Computer Vision Engineer with 3+ years of experience in deep learning and classical computer vision. I help organizations develop perception pipelines to perform object detection, instance segmentation, 6-DoF pose estimation, data engineering and model deployments. I am currently working as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Mujin](https://mujin-corp.com/), a robotic warehouse automation company. Â 

**Technical Skills and Tools**:  
PyTorch, OpenCV, ONNX, PCL, CVAT, Voxel-51, Datumaro, Python, C++, C#  

My most recent project:  

**Walmart Robotic Depalletization Vision System**  
Developed, trained, and deployed an instance segmentation model using PyTorch and ONNX to production. Developed 6-DoF pose estimation and geometric vision pipeline using OpenCV and Point Cloud Library. Optimized vision system to run on CPU at 2-FPS and integrated with robotic system enabling 700 picks per hour.
