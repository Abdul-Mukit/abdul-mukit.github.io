Computer Vision Engineer with 3+ years of experience in deep learning and classical computer vision. I help organizations develop perception pipelines to perform object detection, instance segmentation, 6-DoF pose estimation, data engineering and model deployments.  

**Technical Skills and Tools**:  
PyTorch, OpenCV, ONNX, PCL, Voxel-51, Datumaro, Python, C++, C#  

I am currently working as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Mujin](https://mujin-corp.com/), a robotic warehouse automation company. Here are a few examples of my work:  

**Walmart Robotic Depalletization Vision System [See Projects](https://abdul-mukit.github.io/projects)**  
Developed, trained, and deployed an instance segmentation model using PyTorch and ONNX to production. Developed 6-DoF pose estimation and geometric vision pipeline using OpenCV and Point Cloud Library. Optimized vision system to run on CPU at 2-FPS and integrated with robotic system enabling 700 picks per hour.  

I love connecting with new people. You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdul-mukit-in/)!
