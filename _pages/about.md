Computer Vision Engineer with 3+ years of experience in deep learning and classical computer vision. I help organizations develop perception pipelines to perform object detection, instance segmentation, 6-DoF pose estimation, data engineering and model deployments. I am currently working as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Mujin](https://mujin-corp.com/), a robotic warehouse automation company.  

**Technical Skills and Tools**:  
PyTorch, OpenCV, ONNX, PCL, CVAT, Voxel-51, Datumaro, Python, C++, C#  

My most recent project:  

#### Introduced AI Vision System for Robotic Depalletization [@Mujin](https://mujin-corp.com/depalletizing/)
* Developed and deployed Mujin's first deep learning-assisted robotic vision system for depalletization applications.
* Trained, optimized, and deployed an instance segmentation model, outperforming Mujin's geometry-based vision system’s mAP by 60% and detection speed by 800%
* Collected, distilled, and annotated a large warehouse dataset of 20,000 images. CVAT, Datumaro, SAM, and Voxel51 were used to optimize data and annotations carefully.
* Developed an auto-annotation software to generate ground truth segmentation datasets with 94% mAP automatically.
* Developed point-cloud processing algorithms increasing pose estimation success rate for tilted and damaged boxes by 92%.
