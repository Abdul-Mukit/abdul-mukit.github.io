#### Augmented Reality AR Assistant on [Hololens-2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens)
* Full-stack software development of [Nakamir](https://www.nakamir.com/) Augmented Reality Assistant (NARA).
* Integrated human body pose estimation using the depth sensors in the Microsoft Hololens-2.
* Performed camera calibrations and addressed perception pipeline issues.

**Skills/Tools:** OpenCV, Python, C++, C#, MRTK, Unity, Microsoft Azure.

    NARA (Nakamir AR Assistant) records the hand, eye, and head tracking data and spatial point cloud data. Then NARA, plays it back to another user to create a context-aware virtual assistant. As the first engineer of Nakamir, I helped build the entire software stack.

    I also helped integrate human body pose estimation on the Microsoft Hololens-2. This resulted in an [IEEE publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10322250).
